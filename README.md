# VoteNet
An Implementation of VoteNet: "Deep Hough Voting for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds". Credits to the original authors at https://github.com/facebookresearch/votenet.
The original research paper, which is also used as a reference for this project, is available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09664.pdf.

We adopted existing PointNet++ CUDA implementation. 

We implemented VoteNet by using Tensorflow and Pytorch, by focusing on voting and proposal module.
Also we considered different structure in the network.
